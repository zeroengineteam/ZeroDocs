 #  Properties


---  
 #  Pitch : [real](https://github.com/zeroengineteam/ZeroDocs/code_reference/zilch_base_types/real.markdown)

> The pitch adjustment applied to the node's input. A value of 0 will not affect the sound's pitch; 1 will raise the pitch by an octave and speed up the sound, and -1 will lower the sound by an octave and slow it down. Large pitch changes will likely affect the quality of the sound.
> ``` lang=cpp, name=Zilch
> var Pitch : Real


---  
 #  Semitones : [real](https://github.com/zeroengineteam/ZeroDocs/code_reference/zilch_base_types/real.markdown)

> The pitch adjustment, in semitones (or half-steps), applied to the node's input. A value of 0 will not affect the sound's pitch; 12 will raise the pitch by an octave and speed up the sound, and -12 will lower the sound by an octave and slow it down. Large pitch changes will likely affect the quality of the sound.

 #  InterpolatePitch : Void

> Interpolates the Pitch property from its current value to the value passed in as the first parameter, over the number of seconds passed in as the second parameter.
