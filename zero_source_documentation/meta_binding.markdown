Many other languages have a concept known as reflection which lets you look up information about classes and functions written in that same language. For example, you can look up how many members a class has, or what the type of a member named "Lives" is.

C++ lacks this feature however we are able to build our own version of it in language which we call *Meta*. We use a collection of complex templates and macros to simplify this process.
