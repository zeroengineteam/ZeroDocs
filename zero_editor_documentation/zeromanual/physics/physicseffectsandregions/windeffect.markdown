The [WindEffect](https://github.com/zeroengineteam/ZeroDocs/code_reference/class_reference/WindEffect.markdown) component applies a force in the WindDirection  proportional to the approximate surface area of the object. This force can result in both linear and angular forces.

The WindEffect is primarily used for simulating wind. WindEffect is also useful when a force should consider the surface area as well as the mass of an object, such as with an explosion.

 #  Application Modes
WindEffect expects to be applied as a [Region](https://github.com/zeroengineteam/ZeroDocs/code_reference/class_reference/Region.markdown), [space](https://github.com/zeroengineteam/ZeroDocs/code_reference/class_reference/space.markdown), or Level effect. In these cases, the effect is applied to all objects in the application area. Other effect methods are undefined.
