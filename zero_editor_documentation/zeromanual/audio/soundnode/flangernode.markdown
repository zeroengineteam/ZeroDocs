The [ FlangerNode ](https://github.com/zeroengineteam/ZeroDocs/code_reference/class_reference/flangernode.markdown) collects audio data from all of its inputs and applies a flanger filter before passing it along to its outputs. 

 # Common Uses

- Combining with other audio filters to create sound effects or environmental effects

 # Using the FlangerNode

Flanger filters apply an oscillating delay filter to the audio. The delay will interpolate from `0` milliseconds to the `MaxDelayMillisec` value at the rate set by the `ModulationFrequency` property.
