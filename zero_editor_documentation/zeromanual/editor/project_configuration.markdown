Each Zero project has a handful of settings that can be configured within the editor, such as frame rate and fullscreen editing settings.

 #  Selecting the Project Cog

To modify a project's settings, first open the project. Then, select the Project object cog:

 - In the `Level Window`
  - Press `Shift + P`

**Or**

 - Click `Select  > Select Project`

 #  Project Components

Components found on the Project object cog are unique to it, and cannot be attached to other objects. Not all of the Project object components are accessible from within the Zero Editor.
