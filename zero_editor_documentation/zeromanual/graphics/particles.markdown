Modelling a cloud of dust with individual game objects is prohibitively expensive. We use particle systems to simulate physics for effects such as dust, explosions, and fire.

 # [Sprite Particle System](https://github.com/zeroengineteam/ZeroDocs/zero_editor_documentation/zeromanual/graphics/particles/sprite_particle_system.markdown)
This is the core of sprite based particle systems.

 # [Emitters](https://github.com/zeroengineteam/ZeroDocs/zero_editor_documentation/zeromanual/graphics/particles/emitters.markdown)
Emit Particles based on either standard or custom meshes.

 # [Linear Particle Animator](https://github.com/zeroengineteam/ZeroDocs/zero_editor_documentation/zeromanual/graphics/particles/linear_particle_animator.markdown)
Apply forces to particles.

 # [Particle Color Animator](https://github.com/zeroengineteam/ZeroDocs/zero_editor_documentation/zeromanual/graphics/particles/particle_color_animator.markdown)
Color particles based on time and velocity
